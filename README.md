# A local chat app

The purpose of this undertaking was for me to apply some of my freshly acquired knowledge about the very interesting React library.

This project features a small chat app that aims at providing decent aesthetics and the basic functionality of any chat application. Ironically enough, it doesn't present any actual means of communication and instead employs _dummy_ users, each of whom possesses limited yet unique communicative skills. Therefore, all chat logic operates locally, without the involvement of any databases or web servers.
